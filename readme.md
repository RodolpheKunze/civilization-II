# Civilization - a New Dawn - Automated player

**Important: I do not own anything related to this game (except a physical copy) and the copyright of everything are from [Fantasy Flight](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/index/). I made this project just to play the solo mode because I don't have a printer to print the cards, but it's free to use and it's open source.**

Best played on a tablet or a bigger screen, not made for small screens.
